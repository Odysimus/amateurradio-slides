#Amateur Radio in a Weekend#

This project is intended to provide slide sets that with the aid of an knowledgeable instructor to teach the necessary information to pass the FCC amateur radio exam(s). The inspiration is Dr. John Stanley's (N8GFO) Amateur Radio in a Weekend powerpoint presentation. Most of the content of the technician presentation comes from that powerpoint. An eventual goal is to have presentations, presenter notes, and practice exams for all three license classes.

This project is written in Tex using Beamer. The output files will be hosted somewhere at some point.
